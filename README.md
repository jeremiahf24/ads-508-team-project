Future Finance is currently facing the challenge of accurately predicting customer loan default risk. In order to enhance risk mitigation efforts, the company employs advanced machine learning models to tailoring appropriate risk with its associated clientele, aiming to offer valuable insights on features that contribute to high-risk lending and facilitate data-driven decisions.

Future Finance has developed itself in the banking industry by focusing on delivering personalized financial solutions to its customers. As Future Finance expands, a big challenge begins to emerge: the ability to accurately predict loan default risk for each customer. This challenge is not just about being able to provide more loans to customers and thus secure better customer satisfaction, but also about leveraging predictive analytics and supervised machine learning models as a useful tool for risk management compared to other competitive financial institutions.
